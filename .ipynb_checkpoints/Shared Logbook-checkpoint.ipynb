    "To date I have spent time familiarizing myself with multi-mode pulse propagation, looking in to four wave mixing/ cross phase modulation and translating/optimizing the multi mode pulse propagation code from Matlab to python. A considerable amount of time was spent on the last one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The multi mode code on this date is written in Python in a more \"Pythonic\" way (limiting globals and introducing more functions). The most computationally intensive parts within the code is Fourier transforms and the matrix multiplications within the function evaluations for the Runge-Kutta method. Ways that I have chosen to improve performance are listed bellow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I have tried including Cuda (from Numbapro Anaconda Accelerate). The arrays seem to be way to small to have any real effect on runtime. Also cuFFT proved to be slower because of small arrays.\n",
    "* Cython, but, since the code needs to be adaptable to different studies it would have to be \"naive\" Cython. Leading only to 4% speed-up.\n",
    "* Mkl libraries are installed on my machine by default and Numpy/Scipy operations seem to be all that is needed for a stable, fast and adaptable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally I have looked at the possibility of using another step adaptive Runge-Kutta method to solve the pulse propagation equation. The original code used the Cash-Karp method. I lightly tested the speed and stability of the Dormand–Prince and the Fehlberg method as alternatives. I found that the original method was the most efficient so I kept it.\n",

    "As far as the multi mode code is considered I am able to operate and change it at will. At this time I am awaiting for as much information as I can get about the fibre that the Telecoms experimental group is using so I can simulate it. Until then I will be reading up on multi-mode optical fibres and multi-mode four wave mixing."

Unfortunately, since the fibre is not made on site there is absolutely no knowledge of the characteristics of the fibre, not even the concentration of germanium within it (assuming that it is germanium and not something else). \n",
    "I asked the experimental group to give me some data on the fibre, in particular the $\\beta(\\lambda)$, what I got in return was a Taylor expansion of the first derivative of $\\beta$ with respect to angular frequency. Hence I have learnt not to ask for the dispersion curve again since that term can mean anything in optics. \n",

I am waiting patiently and looking if I have made a mistake in understanding the experimental data. "

    "The search for the refractive index profile failed. We have reason to believe that the fibre has a profile that cannot be recreated from the model above. The end result was approximately 10% error from the measured group velocities BUT the effective areas where double of the measured. This can be attributed to the fibre being created for a different purpose than what it is used for now. Plan B is to approximate the modes as Hermit-Gaussian beams and go from there. All is not bad though because the platform to calculate a graded index profile exists and can be easily called.\n",

    "* Built an optimization algorithm for Degenerate four wave mixing(FWM) and estimated a non-linear refractive index from experimental data that I was given. It was lower than Silica so it is hard to believe that it is the physical constant yet within in there could be other experimental errors. But since it fits I am keeping it.\n",
    "* I was asked to find the optimum phase matching regime when one of the pump wavelengths is moved (non-degenerate FWM). The phase matching term has a linear and non-linear term. Now the non-linear term is easily calculated from the dispersion curves that the team has given me. But the non-linear term depends on the amplitude powers (that change by propagating distance). Books and papers that I have found take approximations that are not fitting to our problems. Peter has thought of an approximation that assumes that there is no change in powers as they propagate. I found that this approximation holds only if the powers are low, the overlaps are small and there is a low non-linear coefficient. Not only that, the contribution from the non-linear term is very low in magnitude. So it can be easily disregarded. \n",

    "    Now I have no idea how the $n_{eff}$ can be calculated before the simulation. This parameter specifies the mode. I could give it to it but that would defeat the purpose of the entire project.\n",
    "    * Another problem that will surface is the implementation of perfectly matched layers as boundary conditions. I have not looked in to this further than fenics does not have it built in."
