# Waveguide Finite Element Analysis (WaFEl)
This repository is dedicated to solving Maxwells equations and fininding the modes of a waveguide using FEniCS as a finite element assembler, Gmsh as a meshing software and Numpy/Scipy for the solver.

The main development is done within the Jupyter notebook.
